<h1>Welcome to the TWC Cybersecurity Virtual Escape Room 2021!</h1>
<h3>The game is simple; we have constructed a series of challenges that you need to complete before the time runs out.</h3>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3>1. Each team must pick a leader. The leader must be able to take control of the session in teams and be able to describe what is happening on the screen to team members.</h3>
<h3>2. The leader can be changed at any time.</h3>
<h3>3. The game begins once the timer starts.</h3>
<h3>4. Participants may use any external resources available to them, including Google.</h3>
<h3>5. At any time, you can ask for a "CLUE"; however, using a clue will cause your team to incur a penalty.</h3>
<h3>6. During each event, there will be two hosts from cybersecurity available to answer questions and help with technical issues.</h3>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>&middot; Each task requires a passcode.</h3>
<h3>&middot; Passcodes are found by finishing the puzzle.</h3>
<h3>&middot; The game ends when you enter the correct code.</h3>
<h3>&middot; Please let the cybersecurity hosts know if an accommodation will be needed.</h3>
<h2>Your first task is to find and unscramble the hidden word. Clicking the hidden word will take you to Task 2.</h2>
<h2>Before starting the game, let us know to start the timer.<//h2>
